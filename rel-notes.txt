coala: Allow users to print selected bears
    This commit enables user to specify bear names to be shown
    provided with options --show-bears --bears. It also allows user
    to specify regex to search bears.
    https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4651

DefaultArgParser: Uni(xi)fy directory separators

    Use a new PathArg type for all cmdline arguments that represent file
    system paths. It replaces OS-native directory separators with Unix-style
    forward slashes. Windows-style backslashes would otherwise be
    interpreted as escaping syntax and therefore removed when turning
    cmdline arguments into coala settings, what makes interactively working
    with coala in a Windows cmdline a pain ;)

    This makes also all the re.escape(filename) hacks in tests obsolete.
    And since they are actually also not working anymore together with
    PathArg, those hacks are removed as part of this commit

    Closes https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/4356

Change default_coafile naming convention

    Changes naming of deafult_coafile and now uses system_coafile.
