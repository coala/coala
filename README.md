INSTALLATION
============

coala can be installed with `python3 setup.py install`. If you need more
information about the installation and dependencies, take a look at our
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

USAGE
=====

If you want to learn more about coala, its functionality and its usage, please
take a look at the [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md) file.

ABOUT
=====

coala is a simple COde AnaLysis Application. Its goal is to make static code
analysis easy while remaining completely modular and therefore extendable.

Code analysis happens in python scripts while coala manages these, tries to
provide helpful libraries and provides multiple user interfaces. (Currently
we support only Console output but others will follow.)

We are currently working hard to make this project reality. coala is currently
in an alpha stage and provides the most basic features. If you want to see how
the development progresses, check out
