ABOUT
=====
coala is a simple COde AnaLysis Application. Its goal is to make static code
analysis easy while remaining completely modular and therefore extendable.
Code analysis happens in python scripts while coala mainly manages these.

This project is not finished and does not provide any real functionality. We
are currently working hard to make it reality.

Authors

Current maintainers and creators are:
Lasse Schuirmann  <lasse@schuirmann.net> and Fabian Neuschmidt <fabian@neuschmidt.de>

INSTALLATION
============
Python
------
coala requires an installation of Python3 >= 3.2 from http://www.python.org.

coala
-----
coala can be installed afterwards by executing the file setup.py through
the python interpreter (root access necessary):
```python3 setup.py install```

You can then use `coala` from the commandline everywhere. Be aware that the
coala script is not yet exposing any functionality.

FUNCTION REFERENCE
==================
coming soon...
