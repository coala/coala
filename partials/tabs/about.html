            <p>coala provides a unified interface for linting and fixing code
              with a single configuration file, regardless of the programming
              languages used. You can use coala from within your favorite
              editor, integrate it with your CI, get the results as JSON, or
              customize it to your needs with its flexible configuration syntax.
            </p>
            <p>coala has a set of official bears (plugins) for several languages,
               including popular languages such as C/C++, Python, JavaScript,
               CSS, Java and many more, in addition to some generic language
               independent algorithms. To learn more about the different
               languages supported and the bears themselves, click below.</p>

            <p>There are two options to run coala:</p>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li>using a .coafile, a project specific configuration file that
                will store all your settings for coala
              <li>using command-line arguments
            </ul>

          </div>
          <div class="card-tabs">
            <ul class="tabs tabs-fixed-width">
              <li class="tab">
                <a class="active" href="#test4">Using a .coafile</a>
              </li>
              <li class="tab">

          <div class="card-content grey lighten-4">
            <div id="test4">
              A sample .coafile will look something like this:
<pre>[Spacing]
files = src/**/*.py
bears = SpaceConsistencyBear
use_spaces = True</pre>
            <ul class="browser-default">
              <li> The <code>files</code> key tells coala which files to lint -
                here we're linting all python files inside the <code>src/</code>
                directory by using a glob expression.
              <li> The <code>bears</code> key specifies which bears (plugins)
                you want to use. We support a huge number of languages and you can
                find the whole list
                <a href="https://github.com/coala/bear-docs/blob/master/README.rst">here</a>
                If you don't find your language there, we've got some
                bears that work for all <a href="https://github.com/coala/bear-docs/blob/master/README.rst#all">languages</a>. Or you can file an issue and we would create a bear for you!
              <li><code>use_spaces</code> enforces spaces over tabs in the codebase.
                <code>use_spaces</code> is a
                setting for the <code>SpaceConsistencyBear</code> defined
                <a href="https://github.com/coala/bear-docs/blob/master/docs/SpaceConsistencyBear.rst">here</a>.
            </ul>

            <code>[Spacing]</code> is a *section*. Sections are executed in the
            order you define them.
            <br>
            Store the file in the project's root directory and run coala:
<pre>$ coala</pre>

            Please read our
            <a href="http://docs.coala.io/en/latest/Users/coafile.html">
              coafile specification
            </a>
            to learn more.
            </div>
            <div id="test6">
              However, if you don't want to save your settings, you can also run coala with
              command line arguments:

  <pre>$ coala --files=setup.py --bears=SpaceConsistencyBear -S use_spaces=True</pre>

  Note that this command does the same thing as having a coafile and running
  <code>coala</code>. The advantage of having a coafile is that you don't need to enter the
  settings as arguments everytime.
  <br><br>
  To get the complete list of arguments and their meaning, run:

  <pre>$ coala --help</pre>
