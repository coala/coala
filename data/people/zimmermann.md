bio: >
  Stefan is just **#coding**; as coalaian, as research software developer in
  the telecom industry, and anyway. Together with his coala students, he makes
  coala [#aspectsYEAH](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md).
  He was himself a student; with passion for Virtual/Augmented Reality
  development. He is fascinated by Bioinformatics, too; and all ways of making
  music. He is building the coala [#bearship](https://coala.io/bearship) for
  colonizing [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org); and whenever people need to get
  convinced of coala, he turns into [Lasse](https://coala.io/#/lasse)'s secret
  `PublicRelationsBear` ;)
