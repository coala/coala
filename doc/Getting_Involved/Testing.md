# Testing

You can help us testing coala in several ways.

# Executing our Tests

coala has a big test suite. It is meant to work on every platform on every PC.
If you just execute our tests you are doing us a favor. You can execute our
tests with our `./run_tests.py` script and report any errors you get!

Note that tests will fail if you do not install all, including optional,
dependencies listed in INSTALL.md in the root directory.
