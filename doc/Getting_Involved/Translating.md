# Translating

This document holds instructions to get you started with translating coala.
coala uses gettext for translations so they are stored in `.po` files.

# Getting a Translation Environment

You are free to use any translation environment you want.

We recomment to grab and install Poedit from http://poedit.net/.

# Translating coala

Our translation files lie in our `locale` directory and are named as usual.
(E.g. german is `de_DE.po`, binary `.mo` files do not lie in the repository and are
generated at installation time.)

The translation process should be straightforward in Poedit or arbitrary other
translation environments.

# Submitting Translations

The easiest way to submit translations is via a GitHub pull request. However,
if this is inconvenient to you, you can send us your `.po` file via email
to <lasse.schuirmann@gmail.com> or any other coala developer.
