*coala* Installation
====================

This document contains information on how to install *coala*. Supported
platforms are Linux and Windows. *coala* is known to work on OS X as well.
*coala* is tested against CPython 3.4 and 3.5.

In order to run *coala* you need to install Python. It is recommended,
that you install Python3 >= 3.4 from `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

The easiest way to install *coala* is using pip (Pip Installs Packages).
If you don't already have pip, you can install it like described in the
`pip installation guide <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing.html>`_. Note
that pip is shipped with recent python versions by default.

To check whether you have pip installed, type the following command which will
also show you more information about your current pip version:
::

    $ pip show pip


System wide installation
------------------------

The simplest way to install *coala* is to do it system-wide. But, This is
generally discouraged in favor or using a virtualenv.

To install the latest most stable version of *coala* and supported bears
system-wide, use:

::

    $ pip3 install coala-bears

.. note::

    For this and all future steps, some steps require root access
    (also known as administrative privileges in Windows).

    **Unix based** (Mac, Linux) - This can be achieved by using ``sudo``
    in front of the command ``sudo command_name`` instead of
    ``command_name``

    **Windows** - The easiest way on windows is to start a
    command prompt as an administrator and start ``setup.py``.

To install the nightly build from our master branch, you can do:

::

    $ pip3 install coala-bears --pre

To install only *coala* (without any bears), you can do:

::

    $ pip3 install coala

With ``--pre`` you can install the nightly build of the *coala* base
without bears.

.. _venv-setup:

Installing inside a virtualenv
------------------------------

Virtualenv is probably what you want to use during development,
you’ll probably want to use it there, too. You can read more about
it at the `virtualenv documentation <http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org>`_.

First, we need to install virtualenv to the system. You may already have this
installed as ``virtualenv`` or ``pyvenv``. If you do not, this can be done
with ``pip3`` easily:

::

    $ pip3 install virtualenv

Once you have virtualenv installed, just fire up a shell and create
your own environment. I usually create a project folder and a ``venv``
folder:

::

    $ virtualenv venv

Now, whenever you want to work on the project, you only have to activate
the corresponding environment.

    On **Unix based** systems (OSX and Linux) this can be done with:

    ::

        $ source venv/bin/activate

    And on **Windows** this is done with:

    ::

        $ venv\scripts\activate

Finally, you install *coala* and supported bears inside the activated
virtualenv with:

::

    (venv)$ pip3 install coala-bears

Installing *coala* from source
------------------------------

If you would like to develop *coala*, you should read our :ref:`dev-notes`
section.

If you only desire to use the latest development version of *coala*, then you
can run

::

    (venv)$ pip3 install coala-bears --pre

which will always install the most recent code from our master branch.

Alternate installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to install *coala* to an alternate location you can e.g. call
``python3 setup.py install --prefix=/your/prefix/location``. Other installation
options are documented in the
`Python docs <https://docs.python.org/3.4/install/#alternate-installation>`_.

.. note::

    If you are using a proxy, follow these steps:

    -  Set up your system-wide proxy.
    -  Use ``sudo -E pip3 install coala`` (the ``-E`` flag takes the
       existing environment variables into the ``sudo`` environment).

    You could also set your pip.conf file to use a proxy, to know more
    read `Using pip behind a proxy on StackOverflow
    <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14149422/using-pip-behind-a-proxy>`_
    for further clarification.

Error handling
--------------

In case you are getting
``ValueError:('Expected version spec in', 'appdirs ~=1.4.0', 'at', ' ~=1.4.0')``
then don't panic. It happens when you are using an outdated version of pip
that doesn't support our version specifiers yet.


    Ideally, you have to create a virtual environment with a newer pip:

    ::

        $ pip3 install virtualenv
        $ virtualenv -p python3 ~/venv/coala
        $ . ~/venv/coala/bin/activate
        $ pip install -U pip
        $ pip install coala-bears

You have to activate this virtualenv on every terminal session you want to use
*coala* though (tip: add it to bashrc!)

Dependencies
------------

This section lists dependencies of *coala* that are not automatically
installed. On Windows, you can get many with ``nuget``
(https://www.nuget.org/), on Mac Homebrew will help you installing
dependencies (http://brew.sh/).

JS Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*coala* features a lot of bears that use linters written in JavaScript. In
order for them to be usable, you need to install them via ``npm``
(http://nodejs.org/):

::

    $ npm install -g jshint alex remark dockerfile_lint csslint coffeelint

If a bear still doesn't work for you, please make sure that you have a
recent version of ``npm`` installed. Many linux distributions ship a
very old one.

.. note::

    If using *coala* from source you can just do ``npm install`` or
    ``npm install -g`` to use the ``package.json`` which is shipped with
    *coala*.

Binary Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some bears need some dependencies available:

-  PHPLintBear: Install ``php``
-  GNUIndentBear: Install ``indent`` (be sure to use GNU Indent, Mac ships
   a non-GNU version that lacks some functionality.)
-  CSharpLintBear: Install ``mono-mcs``

Clang
~~~~~

*coala* features some bears that make use of Clang. In order for them to
work, you need to install libclang:

-  Ubuntu: ``apt-get install libclang1``
-  Fedora: ``dnf install clang-libs`` (Use ``yum`` instead of ``dnf`` on
   Fedora 21 or lower.)
-  ArchLinux: ``pacman -Sy clang``
-  Windows: ``nuget install ClangSharp``
-  OSX: ``brew install llvm --with-clang``

If those do not help you, search for a package that contains
``libclang.so``.

On windows, you need to execute this command to add the libclang path to
the *PATH* variable permanently (you need to be an administrator):

``setx PATH "%PATH%;%cd%\ClangSharp.XXX\content\x86" \M``

For x86 python or for x64 python:

``setx PATH "%PATH%;%cd%\ClangSharp.XXX\content\x64" \M``

Replace "XXX" with the ClangSharp version you received from nuget.

Generating Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*coala* documentation can be generated by fetching the documentation
requirements. This can be achieved by

::

    $ pip3 install -r docs-requirements.txt

To generate the documentation *coala* uses `sphinx`. Documentation can be
generated by running the following command:

::

    $ python3 setup.py docs

You can then open ``docs\_build\html\index.html`` in your favourite
browser.

See :doc:`Writing Documentation <../Getting_Involved/Writing_Documentation>`
for more information.
