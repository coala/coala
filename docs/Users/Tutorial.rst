coala Tutorial
==============

Welcome to this little tutorial. It is meant to be a gentle introduction
to the usage of coala.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to complete this tutorial you will need coala installed.
(Installation is actually not required but it's more convenient and
recommended.)

Get Some Code
-------------

In order to perform a static code analysis on your code you will need
some code to check. If you do not have own code you want to check, you
can retrieve our tutorial samples:

::

    git clone https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-tutorial.git

Please note that the commands given in this tutorial are intended for
use with this sample code and may need minor adjustments.

Let's Start!
------------

There are two options how to let coala know what kind of analysis it
should perform on which code.

Command Line Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to specify the files to analyze, you can use the ``--files``
argument of coala like demonstrated below. For all file paths, you can
specify (recursive) globs.

Because analysis routines can do many various things we named them
*Bears*. Thus you can specify the kind of analysis with the ``--bears``
argument.

Please type the following commands into the console:

::

    cd coala-tutorial
    coala --files=src/\*.c --bears=SpaceConsistencyBear --save

coala will now ask you for missing values that are needed to perform the
analysis, which in this case is only the ``use_spaces`` setting. We
recommend setting it to ``true``.

coala will now check the code and, in case you use the tutorial code,
yield two results. In the case of the SpaceConsistencyBear you will
probably not be able to see those trailing whitespace errors on your
console (yet, we're working on that).

Feel free to experiment a bit. You've successfully analysed some code!
But don't stop reading - you don't have to enter all those values again!

Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

coala supports a very simple configuration file. If you've executed the
instructions from the CLI section above, coala will already have such a
file readily prepared for you. Go, take a look at it:

::

    cat .coafile

This should yield something like this:

::

    [Default]
    bears = SpaceConsistencyBear
    files = src/*.c
    use_spaces = yeah

If you now invoke ``coala`` it will parse this ``.coafile`` from your
current directory. This makes it easy to specify once for your project
what is checked with which bears and make it available to all
contributors.

Feel free to play around with this file. You can either edit it manually
or add/edit settings via ``coala --save ...`` invocations. If you want
coala to save settings every time, you can add ``save = True`` manually
into your ``.coafile``.

Sections
--------

Thats all nice and well but we also have a Makefile for our project we
want to check. So let us introduce another feature of our configuration
syntax: *sections*.

The line ``[Default]`` specifies that everything below will belong to
the Default section. If nothing is specified, a setting will implicitly
belong to this section.

Let's check the line lengths of our Makefile:

::

    coala -S Makefiles.bears=LineLengthBear Makefiles.files=Makefile --save

As you can see, the ``-S`` (or ``--settings``) option allows to specify
arbitrary settings. Settings can be directly stored into a section with
the ``section.setting`` syntax.

By default the ``LineLengthBear`` checks whether each line contains
``80`` chars or less in a line. To change this value, use the
``max_line_length`` inside the ``.coafile``.

coala will now yield any result you didn't correct last time plus a new
one for the Makefile. This time coala (or better, the
``LineLengthBear``) doesn't know how to fix the issue but still tries to
provide as much helpful information as possible and provides you the
option to directly open the file in an editor of your choice.

    **Note:**

    If your editor is already open this may not work, because the other
    process will shortly communicate with the existent process and
    return immediately. coala handles this for some editors
    automatically, if your's does not work yet - please file a bug so we
    can include it!

If you changed one file in multiple results, coala will merge the
changes if this is possible.

coala should have appended something like this to your ``.coafile``:

::

    [Makefiles]
    bears = LineLengthBear
    files = Makefile

As you see, sections provide a way to have different configurations for
possibly different languages in one file. They are executed
sequentially.

Auto-applying results
---------------------

Often you don't want to look at trivial results like spacing issues. For
that purpose coala includes a special setting called ``default_actions``
that allows you to set the action for a bear that shall be automatically
applied on run.

Let's automatically fix python code. Take a look at our sample python
code:

::

    $ cat src/add.py

    """
    This is a simple library that provide a function that can add numbers.

    Cheers!
    """



    def add(a,b):
        return a+b;

    import sys

That looks horrible, doesn't it? Let's fix it!

::

    $ coala -S python.bears=PEP8Bear python.files=\*\*/\*.py \
    python.default_actions=PEP8Bear:ApplyPatchAction --save
    # other output ...
    Executing section python...
    [INFO][11:03:37] Applied 'ApplyPatchAction' for 'PEP8Bear'.
    [INFO][11:03:37] Applied 'ApplyPatchAction' for 'PEP8Bear'.

coala would now fix all spacing issues and without bothering you again.

Currently following actions are available:

-  ``ApplyPatchAction``: Applies a given patch (if existent).
-  ``ShowPatchAction``: Just displays a given patch (if existent)
   without doing something.

For debugging purposes:

-  ``PrintDebugMessageAction``: Prints a debug message for the appearing
   result.

Setting Inheritance
-------------------

All settings in the default section are implicitly inherited to all
other sections (if they do not override their values). We can use that
to save a few lines!

Lets add the following section to our ``.coafile``:

::

    [TODOS]
    bears = KeywordBear

And execute coala with the ``-s`` argument which is the same as
``--save``. I recommend setting case insensitive keywords to
``TODO, FIXME`` and case sensitive keywords empty.

After the results we've already seen, we'll see a new informational one
which informs us that we have a TODO in our code.

Did you note that we didn't specify which files to check this time? This
is because all settings, including ``files = src/*.c``, from the Default
section are already available in every other section implicitly. Thus
the default section is a good point to set things like logging and
output settings or specifying a default set of files to check.

Ignoring Issues
---------------

There are several ways to ignore certain issues, so you aren't lost if
any routines yield false positives.

Ignoring Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

coala lets you ignore whole files through the ``ignore`` setting:

::

    files = **/*.h
    ignore = **/resources.h

This configuration would include all header (``.h``) files but leaves
out resource headers.

Ignoring code Inside Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you need finer-graded ignores. Imagine you have a
``LineLengthBear`` that shall not run on some code segments, because you
can't wrap them:

::

    code = "that's checked normally"

    # Ignore LineLengthBear
    unwrappable_string = "some string that is super-long and would exceed the limit"

You can also skip an area:

::

    # Start ignoring LineLengthBear
    unwrappable_string_2 = unwrappable_string + "yeah it goes even further..."
    another_unwrappable_string = unwrappable_string + unwrappable_string_2
    # Stop ignoring

You can also conditionally combine ignore rules! Bear names will be
split by comma and spaces, invalid bear names like ``and`` will be
ignored.

::

    # Ignore LineLengthBear and SpaceConsistencyBear
        variable = "Why the heck are spaces used instead of tabs..." + "so_long"

If you put an ``all`` instead of the bear names directly after the
``ignore``/``ignoring`` keyword, the results of all bears affecting
those lines will be ignored.

Enabling/Disabling Sections
---------------------------

Now that we have sections we need some way to control, which sections
are executed. coala provides two ways to do that:

Manual Enabling/Disabling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add the line ``TODOS.enabled=False`` to some arbitrary place to
your ``.coafile`` or just ``enabled=False`` into the ``TODOS`` section,
coala will not show the TODOs on every run.

Especially for those bears yielding informational messages which you
might want to see from time to time this is a good way to silence them.

Specifying Targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you provide positional arguments, like ``coala Makefiles``, coala
will execute exclusively those sections that are specified. This will
not get stored in your ``.coafile`` and will take precedence over all
enabled settings. You can specify several targets seperated by a space.

What was that TODO again?

Show bears' information
-----------------------

To get help on using a bear or to get a description of the bear, use the
``--show-bears`` argument:

::

    coala --bears=SpaceConsistencyBear --show-bears

This will display a large amount of information regarding the bears that
have been specified (in the ``.coafile`` of in the CLI arguments). It
shows:

-  A description of what the bear does
-  The sections which uses it
-  The settings it uses (optional and required)

Integrating coala into Your Project
-----------------------------------

It's easy to add coala to your project in a way that does not force your
developers even to install coala using git submodules. This also has the
advantage that all your developers are using exactly the same version of
coala. You can try it out in the coala-tutorial repository:

::

    git submodule add https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala.git
    git commit -m 'Add coala submodule'
    git add .coafile
    git commit -m 'Add .coafile'

You can now use ``coala/coala`` as if it were the installed binary.
Here's the instructions for your developers:

::

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    coala/coala

Continuing the Journey
----------------------

If you want to know about more options, take a look at our help with
``coala -h``. If you liked or disliked this tutorial, feel free to drop
us a note at our bug tracker (github) or mailing list
(https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coala-devel).

If you need more flexibility, know that coala is extensible in many ways
due to its modular design:

-  If you want to write your own bears, take a look at sources lying in
   ``bears`` and ``coalib/bearlib``.
-  If you want to add custom actions for results, take a look at the
   code in ``coalib/results/results_actions``.
-  If you want to have some custom outputs (e.g. HTML pages, a GUI or
   voice interaction) take a look at modules lying in ``coalib/output``.

Happy coding!
