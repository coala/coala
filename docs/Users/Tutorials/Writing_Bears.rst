Guide to Write a Bear
=====================

Welcome. This document presents information on how to write a bear for
coala. It assumes you know how to use coala. If not please read our main
tutorial!

The sample sources for this tutorial lie at our coala-tutorial
repository, go clone it with:

::

    git clone https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-tutorial.git

All paths and commands given here are meant to be executed from the root
directory of the coala-tutorial repository.

What is a bear?
---------------

A bear is meant to do some analysis on source code. The source code will
be provided by coala so the bear doesn't have to care where it comes from
or where it goes.

A bear can communicate with the user via two ways:

-  Via log messages
-  Via results

Log messages will be logged according to the users settings and are
usually used if something goes wrong. However you can use debug for
providing development related debug information since it will not be
shown to the user by default. If error/failure messages are used, the
bear is expected not to continue analysis.

A Hello World Bear
------------------

Below is the code given for a simple bear that sends a debug message for
each file:

.. code:: python

    from coalib.bears.LocalBear import LocalBear


    class HelloWorldBear(LocalBear):
        def run(self,
                filename,
                file):
            self.debug("Hello World! Checking file", filename, ".")

This bear is stored at ``./bears/HelloWorldBear``

In order to let coala execute this bear you need to let coala know where
to find it. We can do that with the ``-d`` (``--bear-dirs``) argument:

``coala -f src/*.c -d bears -b HelloWorldBear -L DEBUG``

.. note::

    The given bear directories must not have any glob expressions in them. Any
    character that could be interpreted as a part of a glob expression will be
    escaped. Please use comma separated values to give several such
    directories instead.

You should now see the debug message for our sample file.

The Bear class also supports ``warn`` and ``err``.

Communicating with the User
---------------------------

Now we can send messages through the queue, we can do the real work.
Lets say:

-  We want some information from the user (e.g. the tab width if we rely
   on indentation)
-  We've got some useful information for the user and want to show it to
   him. This might be some issue with his code or just an information
   like the number of lines.

So let's extend our HelloWorldBear a bit, I've named the new bear with
the creative name CommunicationBear:

.. code:: python

    from coalib.bears.LocalBear import LocalBear
    from coalib.results.Result import Result


    class CommunicationBear(LocalBear):

        def run(self,
                filename,
                file,
                user_input: str):
            """
            Communicates with the user.

            :param user_input: Arbitrary user input.
            """
            self.debug("Got '{ui}' as user input of type {type}.".format(
                ui=user_input,
                type=type(user_input)))

            return [Result.from_values(message="A hello world result.",
                                       origin=self,
                                       file=filename)]

Try executing it:

::

    coala -f=src/\*.c -d=bears -b=CommunicationBear -L=DEBUG

Hey, we'll get asked for the user\_input! Wasn't that easy? Go ahead,
enter something and observe the output.

So, what did coala do here?

First, coala looked at the parameters of the run method and found that
we need some value named user\_input. Then it parsed our documentation
comment and found a description for the parameter which was shown to us
to help us choose the right value. After the needed values are provided,
coala converts us the value into a string because we've provided the
``str`` annotation for this parameter. If no annotation is given or the
value isn't convertible into the desired data type, you will get a
``coalib.settings.Setting.Setting``.

Your docstring can also be used to tell the user what exactly your bear
does.

Try executing

::

    coala -d bears -b CommunicationBear --show-bears

This will show the user a bunch of information related to the bear like:
- A description of what the bear does - The sections which uses it - The
settings it uses (optional and required)

What Data Types are Supported?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Setting does support some very basic types:

-  String (``str``)
-  Float (``float``)
-  Int (``int``)
-  Boolean (``bool``, will accept values like ``true``, ``yes``,
   ``yeah``, ``no``, ``nope``, ``false``)
-  List of strings (``list``, values will be split by comma)
-  Dict of strings (``dict``, values will be split by comma and colon)

If you need another type, you can write the conversion function yourself
and use this function as the annotation (if you cannot convert value, be
sure to throw ``TypeError`` or ``ValueError``). We've provided a few
advanced conversions for you:

-  ``coalib.settings.Setting.path``, converts to an absolute file path
   relative to the file/command where the setting was set
-  ``coalib.settings.Setting.path_list``, converts to a list of absolute
   file paths relative to the file/command where the setting was set
-  ``coalib.settings.Setting.typed_list(typ)``, converts to a list and
   applies the given conversion (``typ``) to each element.
-  ``coalib.settings.Setting.typed_ordered_dict(key_type, value_type,
   default)``, converts to a dict while applying the ``key_type``
   conversion to all keys, the ``value_type`` conversion to all values
   and uses the ``default`` value for all unset keys. Use ``typed_dict``
   if the order is irrelevant for you.

Results
-------

In the end we've got a result. If a file is provided, coala will show
the file, if a line is provided, coala will also show a few lines before
the affecting line. There are a few parameters to the Result
constructor, so you can e.g. create a result that proposes a code change
to the user. If the user likes it, coala will apply it automatically -
you don't need to care.

Your function needs to return an iterable of ``Result`` objects: that
means you can either return a ``list`` of ``Result`` objects or simply
yield them and write the method as a generator.

.. note::

    We are currently planning to simplify Bears for bear writers and us.
    In order to make your Bear future proof, we recommend writing your
    method in generator style.

    Don't worry: in order to migrate your Bears to our new API, you will
    likely only need to change two lines of code. For more information
    about how bears will look in the future, please read up on
    https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala/issues/725 or ask us on
    https://gitter.im/coala-analyzer/coala.

Bears Depending on Other Bears
------------------------------

So we've got a result, but what if we need our Bear to depend on results from
a different Bear?

Well coala has an efficient dependency management system that would run the
other Bear before your Bear and get its results for you. All you need to do is
to tell coala which Bear(s) you want to run before your Bear.

So let's see how you could tell coala which Bears to run before yours:

.. code:: python

    from coalib.bears.LocalBear import LocalBear
    from bears.somePathTo.OtherBear import OtherBear

    class DependentBear(LocalBear):

        def run(self, filename, file, dependency_results):
            results = dependency_results[OtherBear.__name__]

        @staticmethod
        def get_dependencies():
            return [OtherBear]

As you can see we have a :meth:`~coalib.bears.Bear.Bear.get_dependencies`
method which returns a list of bears we wish to depend on.
In this case it is a list with 1 item: "OtherBear".

.. note::
    The list must have classes of the bear itself, not the name as a string.

coala searches for the ``get_dependencies`` function before executing
the ``DependentBear`` and runs all the Bears which are returned by it.

After running these bears, coala gives all the results returned by the Bears
in the ``dependency_results`` dictionary, which has the Bear's name as a key
and a list of results as the value. E.g. in this case, we would have
``dependency_results ==
{'OtherBear' : [list containing results of OtherBear]]}``.

.. note::
    ``dependency_results`` is a keyword here and it cannot be called by
    any other name.

Hidden Results
--------------
Apart from regular Results, coala provides HiddenResults, which are used
to share data between Bears as well as giving results which are not shown to
the user. This feature is specifically for Bears that are dependencies of other
Bears, and do not want to return Results which would be displayed when the
bear is run.

Let's see how we can use HiddenResults in our Bear:

.. code:: python

    from coalib.bears.LocalBear import LocalBear
    from coalib.results.HiddenResult import HiddenResult

    class OtherBear(LocalBear):

        def run(self, filename, file):
            yield HiddenResult(self, ["Some Content", "Some Other Content"])

Here we see that this Bear (unlike normal Bears) yields a
:class:`~coalib.results.HiddenResult` instead of a ``Result``. The first
parameter in ``HiddenResult`` should be the instance of the Bear that yields
this result (in this case ``self``), and second argument should be the content
we want to transfer between the Bears. Here we use a list of strings as content
but it can be any object.
