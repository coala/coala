What are those things failing/passing on my Pull Request?
---------------------------------------------------------

We use a few checks to make sure your Pull Request is ready to be merged into
our master branch. Right now we use 7 of those checks:

- **review/gitmate/commit** Checks this particular commit has any new gitmate
  issues.

- **review/gitmate/pr** Checks whether your code respects our styling (PEP8),
  doesn't contain unneeded newlines, trailing whitespace, etc. Basically it is
  like running coala over your code, so to fix this, simply run ``$ coala``
  before pushing! In case you have multiple commits, and the issue is in one
  of them, the status will still be failed, so be careful to run ``$ coala``
  before making each commit.

- **review/gitmate/manual** This one is the only one that is manual, this can be
  given by any coala member and shows that the commit has been reviewed and
  has no problems, so it is ready to be merged. It can be done by commenting
  ``ack commit_sha``. For more information about the whole process, we have
  it all docummented
  `here <http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting_Involved/Review.html>`__.

- **scrutinizer** Checks for the code quality, and points out all the code
  elements that were added, such as functions, classes, etc.

- **codecov/project** This one checks whether all your code is being tested. We
  cannot merge anything that may not work or may broke somewhere, so to avoid
  obvious bugs we use this. To fix it, write doctests or unittests for your
  functions / classes.

- **ci/circleCI** This is one of the two containers we use to continuously
  test the code. It basically runs all the tests and checks your code in a
  container, checking that the tests pass on the container. This one is for
  Linux, it runs Ubuntu 12.04.

- **continuous-integration/appveyor/pr** This one does the same as the one
  above, but for Windows, both 32 and 64bits versions.
