Welcome to the Newcomers guide!
=======

This guide will help you to get involved and teach you how to make your first
contribution to coala!

Meet the community!
-------------------

To get started, the first way is to meet the community. We use gitter to
communicate, and there the helpful community will guide you.

::

    https://gitter.im/coala-analyzer/coala


Congratulations! You are now part of our community.

Start working
-------------

Let us know that you are willing to contribute and you will be added to our
organization on github. This is your first step towards contributing.
The invitation will be sent upon mail and you will have to accept it to join.

Now that you are part of our organization, you can start working on issues.

::

    https://github.com/coala-analyzer


Get help with git
-----------------

We use github to manage our repository. If you're not familiar with git, we
strongly recommend following a tutorial, such as:

::

    https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1


If there's anything unclear, or you are encountering problems, feel free
to contact us on git, and we will help you!

Start working
-------------

Now is the time to pick an issue.

::

    https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala/issues


You can also filter on git to make it show only newcomer issues.
Here are two links that will lead you to only newcomers issues:

::

    For coala project: https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adifficulty%2Fnewcomer

    Also, for our coala-bears: https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala-bears/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adifficulty%2Fnewcomer

    For more information about what bears are, please check the following link:
    http://coala.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Users/Tutorials/Writing_Bears.html

The easy issues that will help you get started are labeled as
"difficulty/newcomer" and are only there to give you a glimpse of how it is
working with us. Now pick an issue, and if you want to fix it, then leave
a comment that you would like to get assigned. This way we don't have more
people working on the same issue at the same time.
Now you can start working on it.

.. note::

    Careful! For more information about creating commit messages, check:
    http://coala.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Getting_Involved/Writing_Good_Commits.html


Sending your changes
--------------------

Now that you've fixed the issue, you've tested it and you think it is ready
to be used, create a commit and push it to your fork, using:

::

    "$ git push origin fix-branch -f", where -f is short for --force.


Creating a Pull Request
-----------------------

Now that your commit has been sent to your fork, it is time
to do a Pull Request. It can be done by accessing your fork on github and
clicking "New Pull Request".

Congratulations! You have now created your first Pull Request!
Now your code will be tested by our checkers and also gitmate, which will tell
you stuff as if your commit message was wrongly written. If you have passed
all those tests, your code has to be reviewed by one of your maintaining
developers. If they consider that you have issues on your code, you will be
able to modify it and then add the files manually again using git, and use
git commit --amend. This will edit your last commit. This command also allows
you to edit your commit message.
The other way around, if it gets merged, you are good to go! You have
contributed to coala! Congratulations!
