# Codestyle for coala

coala follows the [PEP8 codestyle](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
with a maximum line length of 80 characters including newline. Invoke `coala`
to let it correct your code automatically.

# Additional Style Guidelines

## Documentation Comments

A documentation comment consists of 2 parts - the description of what the
function/class/module does followed by the parameters it takes in, the
return value it gives out and the exceptions it can raise.

Nothing should be written on the first and last line where the docstring
begins and ends, and a newline should separate the description and the rest.
Each message in the documentation comment must end with a full-stop. Also
the description of all arguments and the return value should begin at the
same column.

Example:

```
def area(length, breadth):
    """
    Finds the area of a rectangle of the given length and breadth.

    :param length:      The length of the rectangle.
    :param breadth:     The breadth of the rectangle.
    :return:            The area of the rectangle.
    :raises ValueError: Raises ValueError if the arguments are not of type
                        float or int.
    """
```

If the description for a param or other keywords exceeds 1 line, continue
it in the next. Make sure that the second line is aligned Below the first
line.

Example :
```
:param something: A very long line describing the variable something
                  in great detail.
:return:          This message also started in the same column and it
                  starts again at the same column as the rest of the messages.
```

## Type Checking

If you want to assure that parameters have a certain type, you can use the
`enforce_signature` decorator and simply annotate your function with the allowed
types:

```python
@enforce_signature
def concatenate_strings(a: str, b: str, c: (str, None)=None):
    if c is None:
        c = ""
    return a + b + c
```

This will raise a `TypeError` if `a`, `b` or `c` are no strings and `c` is not
`None`.
