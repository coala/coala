# Introduction

At coala we are looking heavily at the maintainability of the code.

> Code is more often read than written!

It is obvious that we need good code. In order to do that we are verifying that
every change to our code (i.e. the commits) is making it better.

## What Makes a Good Commit

A good commit is atomic. It describes but only one logical change and not more.
Why do we do that? Because we find more bugs if we do! Also it features a good
commit message.

## Why Do We Need Good Commits?

 * An atomic commit is way easier to review. The reviewer thus will be able
   to review faster and find more bugs due to the lower complexity of the
   change.
 * Atomic commits are like good objects in object oriented programming - you
   can split up a bigger thing into many small objects. Reducing complexity is
   the key to developing good software and finding its bug before they occur.
 * Good commit messages make it easy to check at a glance what happened in a
   time range.
 * It is way easier to revert single changes without side effects. Reverting
   multiple commits at a time is easy, reverting a part of a commit is not.
 * `git blame` will be much more effective. It is the best documentation you
   can get. The older your code is, the more documentation it has. The better
   the commit messages are, the better is your hidden documentation. Your
   commit messages document the reason for every single change you did to any
   line.
 * `git bisect` will be much more effective. If you bisect through atomic
   commits to find the commit which caused a bug, you should be able to
   identify the real cause of the bug fastly. Good commit messages and
   atomicity of commits are key to that ability.

# How to Write Good Commit Messages

There are a few things to consider when writing a commit message, namely:

 * The first line may hold up to 50 chars excluding newline and is called
   shortlog.
 * The shortlog should have a tag and must have a short description:
   `tag: Short description`.
   * The tag is usually the affected class or package and not mandatory. It
     gives context to the commit.
   * The short description starts with a big letter and is written in
     imperative present tense (i.e. `Add something`, not `Adding something` or
     `Added something`). It has no trailing period.
 * The second line must be empty.
 * All following lines may hold up to 72 chars excluding newline.
   * These lines are the long description. The long description is not
     mandatory but may help expressing what you're doing.
 * The shortlog shall describe the _change_ as exactly as possible. If it
   is a bugfix, don't describe the bug but the _change_.
 * In the long description you can add reasoning for your changes. This is
   especially important for complex changes that are not self explanatory. This
   is also the right place to explain related bugs.
 * If the commit fixes a bug, add the following line at the end:
   `Fixes https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala/issues/###`, this way the
   commit will appear at the bug and several revisions can be tracked this way.
   * Be sure to use the full URL, if we move from github, the links should
     still work.
   * This will automatically close the according bug when pushed to master if
     you have the permissions on GitHub.

# Example

```
setup: Install .coafile via package_data

When installing the .coafile to distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib, we
ignore that this is not the installation directory in every case. Thus
it is easier, more reliable and platform independent to let distutils
install it by itself.
