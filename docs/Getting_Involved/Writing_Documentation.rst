Writing Documentation
=====================

This document gives a short introduction on how to write documentation
for the coala project.

Documentation is written in reStructuredText and rendered by readthedocs.org to
our lovely users. You can view the current documentation on
http://coala.rtfd.org.

After getting the coala source code (see :doc:`Installation
Instructions <../Users/Install>`), you can start hacking on
existent documentation files. They reside in the ``docs`` directory and
are written in reStructuredText.

If you want to add new pages, you need to alter the ``index.rst`` file
in the coala ``docs`` directory. Please read
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/toctree.html#toctree-directive
for an explanation of the syntax.

You can test the documentation locally through simply running
``make html`` in the coala ``docs`` directory. This generates 
``docs\_build\html\index.html`` that you can view on your browser. (Use
``pip install sphinx`` if you do not have ``sphinx`` yet.)
