Rankings
========

The coala community is split into different ranks which have different rights
and obligations. This page will explain which the ranks are and what you need
to do to get promoted to a higher rank.

Currently the ranks can be seen `here <https://github.com/orgs/coala/teams>`__
and are as it follows:

 - newcomers
 - developers
 - maintainers
 - admins

The Newcomer Rank
-----------------

Everyone starts here. This is the rank where you can get a promotion easiest
and which has the lowest obligations, and, obviously, the lowest rights.

Rights
~~~~~~

The newcomers have no write access, and no direct labelling rights. However,
being a newcomer lets you be assigned to issues, which helps not having
conflicts on working on issues.

How to get promoted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you complete the following tasks, you will become a developer at coala:

  - run coala on a project of yours
  - merge a ``difficulty/newcomer`` Pull Request
  - review at least a ``difficulty/newcomer`` Pull Request
  - merge a ``difficulty/low`` Pull Request
  - review at least a ``difficulty/low`` or higher Pull Request

When you ran coala on a project, please fill our
`usability survey <http://coala.io/usability>`_. Once you got your first Pull
Request merged successfully, fill in our
`survey form <http://coala.io/newform>`_ which can help us making your
experience better!

Once you have achieved all these, just ask to be promoted on the chat and
provide links to your reviews and merged Pull Requests. Then, you will be able
to name yourself a coala developer!

The Developer Rank
------------------

The developers team consists of people that have already proven themselves,
both on the coding side and the reviewing side.

Rights
~~~~~~

The developers can:

 - use cobot to label PRs
 - acknowledge commits that are ready to merge

For more information about reviewing, simply type ``cobot explain review``
on https://coala.io/chat.

How to get promoted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no simple process that you have to complete in order to become a
maintainer, such as there is to become a developer. In order to get promoted
to a maintainer, you need to:

 - be a reliable community member
 - review PRs consistently (not necessarily a PR each day, but a
   few each week at least)
 - merge at least a ``difficulty/medium`` Pull Request

Once you've done these, at least two maintainers need to vouch for you to be
included in the maintainers team.

The Maintainer Rank
-------------------

The maintainers team is the team that coordinates mostly what code goes into
the master branch and helps decide actions and policies that are taken at coala.

Rights
~~~~~~

Maintainers have the developer rights. They can also:

 - manually label PRs
 - label issues
 - merge Pull Requests into the master branch
 - vouch for people to be included in the maintainers team

The Admin Rank
--------------

The admin rank is reached only by the people with rights over everything
coala has, and is usually unachievable by normal maintainers, as it does not
give any extra power in terms of the merging/reviewing processes.
