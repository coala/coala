### Check list


- [ ] I have rebased properly.
      [Please see this for a tutorial.](http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developers/Git_Basics.html#rebasing)
- [ ] I have gone through the
      [commit guidelines](http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html)
      and I've followed them:
 - [ ] I have followed the
       [guidelines for the commit shortlog](http://docs.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html#shortlog).
 - [ ] I have followed the
       [guidelines for the commit body](http://docs.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html#commit-body).
 - [ ] I have included the issue URL with the  `Fixes` keyword if the
       commit fixes a *real bug* and the `Closes` keyword if it adds a
       feature/enhancement.
       [See more here.](http://docs.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html#issue-reference)
- [ ] I have [run all the tests](http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developers/Executing_Tests.html)
      and they all pass. If any CI (below) is not green, please fix them. If
      GitMate issues appear you will have to amend your commits, pushing new
      commits on top is not sufficient!
