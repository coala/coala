coala: Linting and fixing code for all languages
------------------------------------------------

**coala provides a unified command-line interface for linting and fixing all
your code, regardless of the programming languages you use.**

With coala, users can create
`rules and standards <http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users/coafile.html>`__
to be followed in the source
code. coala has an **user-friendly interface** that is completely customizable.
It can be used in any environment and is completely modular.

coala has a set of official bears (plugins) for several languages, including
popular languages such as **C/C++**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**,
**Java** and many more, in addition to some generic language independent
algorithms. To learn more about the different languages supported and the
bears themselves,
`click here. <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/README.rst>`__

To see what coala can do for your language, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ coala --show-bears --filter-by-language Python

============
Installation
============

To install the **latest stable version** run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install coala

|Stable|

To install the latest development version run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install coala --pre

The latest code from the master branch is automatically deployed as the
development version in PyPI.

To also install all bears for coala at once run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install coala-bears

You can also use ``cib`` (coala Installs Bears), which is an experimental bear
manager that lets you install, upgrade, uninstall, check dependencies, etc.
for bears. To install it, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install cib

For usage instructions, consult
`this link <http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developers/Bear_Installation_Tool.html>`__.

=====
Usage
=====

There are two options to run coala:

* using a ``.coafile``, a project specific configuration file that will store
  all your settings for coala
* using command-line arguments

Using a ``.coafile``
********************

A sample ``.coafile`` will look something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    [Spacing]
    files = src/**/*.py
    bears = SpaceConsistencyBear
    use_spaces = True

* The ``files`` key tells coala which files to lint - here we're linting all
  python files inside the ``src/`` directory by using a glob expression.
* The ``bears`` key specifies which bears (plugins) you want to use. We support
  a huge number of languages and you can find the whole list
  `here <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/README.rst>`__.
  If you don't find your langauge there, we've got some
  `bears that work for all languages <https://github.com/coala-analyzer/bear-docs/blob/master/README.rst#all>`__. Or you can file an issue and we would create a bear for you!
* ``use_spaces`` enforces spaces over tabs in the codebase. ``use_spaces`` is a
  setting for the ``SpaceConsistencyBear``.

``[Spacing]`` is a *section*. Sections are executed in the order you
define them.

Store the file in the project's root directory and run coala:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ coala

Please read our
`coafile specification <http://coala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users/coafile.html>`__
to learn more.

Using command-line arguments
****************************

However, if you don't want to save your settings, you can also run coala with
command line arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ coala --files=setup.py --bears=SpaceConsistencyBear -S use_spaces=True

Note that this command does the same thing as having a coafile and running
`coala`. The advantage of having a coafile is that you don't need to enter the
settings as arguments everytime.

To get the complete list of arguments and their meaning, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ coala --help

You can find a quick demo of coala here:
