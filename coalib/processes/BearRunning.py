    This is the method that is actually runs by processes.

    If parameters type is 'queue (read)' this means it has to implement the
    get(timeout=TIMEOUT) method and it shall raise queue.Empty if the queue
    is empty up until the end of the timeout. If the queue has the
    (optional!) task_done() attribute, the run method will call it after
    processing each item.

    If parameters type is 'queue (write)' it shall implement the
    put(object, timeout=TIMEOUT) method.

    If the queues raise any exception not specified here the user will get
    an 'unknown error' message. So beware of that.
