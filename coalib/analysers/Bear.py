    This is the base class for every analyser. If you want to write an analyser, inherit from this class and overwrite
    at least the run_analyser method. You can send debug/warning/error messages through the debug_msg(), warn_msg(),
    fail_msg() functions. These will send the appropriate messages so that they are outputted. Be aware that if you
    use fail_msg(), you are expected to also terminate the analyser run-through immediately.

    If you need some setup or teardown for your analyser, feel free to overwrite the set_up() and tear_down() functions.
    They will be invoked before/after every run_analyser invocation.

    Settings are available at all times through self.settings. You can access the translation database with the self._()
    function, it will be routed to the usual gettext _(). Be aware that the strings you use are not necessarily in the
    database, especially if your analyser is not shipped with coala. Feel free to use your own translation database in
    this case or consider make your analyser available to the coala project.
