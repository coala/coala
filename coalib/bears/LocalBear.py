    A LocalBear is a Bear that analyzes only one file at once. It therefore can not analyze semantical facts over
    multiple files or so.

    This has the advantage that it can be highly parrallelized. In addition the results from multiple bears for one
    file can be shown together for that file which is better to grasp for the user. coala takes care of all that.

    Examples for LocalBear's could be:
    - A SpaceConsistencyBear that checks every line for trailing whitespaces, tabs, ...
    - A VariableNameBear that checks variable names and constant names for certain conditions
