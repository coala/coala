    """
    A bear contains the actual subroutine that is responsible for checking
    source code for certain specifications. However it can actually do
    whatever it wants with the files it gets. If you are missing some Result
    type, feel free to contact us and/or help us extending the coalib.

    This is the base class for every bear. If you want to write an bear, you
    will probably want to look at the GlobalBear and LocalBear classes that
    inherit from this class. In any case you'll want to overwrite at least the
    run method. You can send debug/warning/error messages through the
    debug(), warn(), err() functions. These will send the
    appropriate messages so that they are outputted. Be aware that if you use
    err(), you are expected to also terminate the bear run-through
    immediately.

    If you need some setup or teardown for your bear, feel free to overwrite
    the set_up() and tear_down() functions. They will be invoked
    before/after every run invocation.

    Settings are available at all times through self.section. You can access
    coalas translation database with the _() from coalib.misc.i18n. Be aware
    that the strings you use are probably not in the database, especially if
    your bear is not shipped with coala. Feel free to use your own
    translation database in this case or consider make your bear available
    to the coala project.
