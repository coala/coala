    Runs a single command in shell and provides stdout, stderr and stdin
    streams.

    This function creates a context manager that sets up the process (using
    ``subprocess.Popen()``), returns to caller and waits for process to exit on
    leaving.

    By default the process is opened in ``universal_newlines`` mode and creates
    pipes for all streams (stdout, stderr and stdin) using ``subprocess.PIPE``
    special value. These pipes are closed automatically, so if you want to get
    the contents of the streams you should retrieve them before the context
    manager exits.

    ...     stdout = p.stdout
    ...     stdout_text = stdout.read()
    >>> stdout_text
    'TEXT\\n'
    >>> stdout.closed
    True

    Custom streams provided are not closed except of ``subprocess.PIPE``.

                    using ``shlex.split()``. If providing ``shell=True`` as a
                    keyword-argument, no ``shlex.split()`` is performed and the
                    command string goes directly to ``subprocess.Popen()``.
