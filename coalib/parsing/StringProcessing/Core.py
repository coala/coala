    Searches for a string enclosed between a specified begin- and end-sequence.
    Also enclosed \\n are put into the result. Doesn't handle escape sequences,
    but supports nesting.

    Nested sequences are ignored during the match. Means you get only the first
    nesting level returned. If you want to acquire more levels, just reinvoke
    this function again on the return value.

    Using the same begin- and end-sequence won't match anything.

    :param begin:                A pattern that defines where to start
                                 matching.
    :param end:                  A pattern that defines where to end matching.
    :param string:               The string where to search in.
    :param max_matches:          Defines the maximum number of matches. If 0 or
                                 less is provided, the number of splits is not
                                 limited.
    :param remove_empty_matches: Defines whether empty entries should
                                 be removed from the result. An entry is
                                 considered empty if no inner match was
