    A result is anything that has an origin and a message.

    Optionally it might affect a file.

    When sorting a list of results with the implemented comparision routines
    you will get an ordering which follows the following conditions,
    while the first condition has the highest priority, which descends to the
    last condition.
    1. Results with no files will be shown first
    2. Results will be sorted by files (ascending alphabetically)
    3. Results will be sorted by lines (ascending)
    4. Results will be sorted by severity (descending, major first, info last)
    5. Results will be sorted by origin (ascending alphabetically)
    6. Results will be sorted by message (ascending alphabetically)
    7. Results will be sorted by debug message (ascending alphabetically)
