class SectionCreatable:
    """
    A SectionCreatable is an object that is creatable out of a section object. Thus this is the class for many helper
    objects provided by the bearlib.

    If you want to use an object that inherits from this class the following approach is recommended:
    Instantiate it via the from_section method. You can provide default arguments via the lower case keyword
    arguments. Example:
        SpacingHelper.from_section(section, tabwidth=8)
    creates a SpacingHelper and if the "tabwidth" setting is needed and not contained in section, 8 will be taken.

    In addition you might want to implement the get_needed_settings method of your bear in the following manner
    (exemplary):
        def get_needed_settings():
            needed_settings = {}  # Get your needed settings

            # Retrieve minimal needed settings from SpacingHelper and add them to the dict
            needed_settings.extend(SpacingHelper.get_minimal_needed_settings())
            return needed_settings

    If you don't want to rely on any defaults you can get a dict of all settings needed by the object via:
        SpacingHelper.get_needed_settings()

    Please consider that it is usually good to guess settings for the user if it is possible to do a reasonable guess
    that suits most needs. Thus the use of get_minimal_needed_settings is preferred over get_needed_settings.
