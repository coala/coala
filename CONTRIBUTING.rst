PR Merge Criteria
-----------------

For a PR to be merged, the following statements must hold true:

-  All CI services pass. (CircleCI, AppVeyor, Scrutinizer, CodeCov)
-  All commits must have been reviewed and approved by GitMate and a *coala*
   maintainer who is not the author of the PR.
-  Commits shall comply to the commit guidelines as outlined in the
   docs.

Commit guidelines can be found at the
`Good Commits page <https://coala.io/commit>`__

Correcting PRs
--------------

Rebasing PRs is preferred over merging master into the source branches again
and again cluttering our history. If a reviewer has suggestions, the commit
shall be amended so the history is not cluttered by “fixup commits”.

For further information/queries feel free to discuss with us on
`gitter <https://gitter.im/coala/coala>`__.
