### Attention: This release is old and experimenental.

coala 0.1 provides basic functionality. It is not feature complete but already
useful according to some people.

For information about the purpose of coala please look at the README provided
with each source distribution.

Note that this is a prerelease, thus this release will be supported with only
important bugfixes for limited time (at least until 0.2.0 is released). Linux
is the only supported platform.

Documentation for getting started with coala is provided here:
